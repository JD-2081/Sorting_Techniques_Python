  - Time Complexity: **O(N²)**
- **Optimized Approach**
  - Time Complexity: **O(N)** (Best Case when the array is already sorted)

### Insertion Sort
- Time Complexity: **O(N²)**

This repository contains implementations of various sorting techniques in Python. Feel free to contribute or suggest improvements!
